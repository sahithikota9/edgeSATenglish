      <div class="mistake-card">
        <h3>1. Subject-Verb Agreement</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The list of items are on the desk.<br>
           <strong>Correction:</strong> The list of items <strong>is</strong> on the desk.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Identify the subject of the sentence, not a phrase that comes between the subject and verb. Singular subjects need singular verbs; plural subjects need plural verbs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mistake-card">
        <h3>2. Misplaced Modifier</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> She almost drove her kids to school every day.<br>
           <strong>Correction:</strong> She drove her kids to school almost every day.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Place descriptive words/phrases close to the word they modify. Misplaced modifiers can make sentences confusing or change the meaning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mistake-card">
        <h3>3. Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Every student must submit their homework.<br>
           <strong>Correction:</strong> Every student must submit <strong>his or her</strong> homework.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Pronouns must agree in number with the nouns they replace. “Everyone,” “each,” “every student” are singular, so use “his or her” instead of “their.”</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mistake-card">
        <h3>4. Wrong Verb Tense</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> He will went to the store yesterday.<br>
           <strong>Correction:</strong> He <strong>went</strong> to the store yesterday.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure past, present, and future tenses are used consistently. “Yesterday” signals past tense, so “went” is correct, not “will go.”</p>
      </div>

      <div class="mistake-card">
        <h3>5. Dangling Modifier</h3>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Walking down the street, the trees were beautiful.<br>
           <strong>Correction:</strong> Walking down the street, <strong>I saw</strong> the beautiful trees.</p>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure the subject performing the action is clear. Dangling modifiers occur when the introductory phrase does not clearly refer to the subject of the main clause.</p>
